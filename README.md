This is a server-side code for store a list of your favorite movies,including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. It can serve this data as a web page allowing visitors to review their movies and watch the trailers.


# Getting Start

1. Install Python
2. Create multiple instances in `entertainment_center` to store your favorite movies, group movie title, box art URL (or poster URL) and a YouTube link to the movie trailer in a list.
3. There is a starter code repository that contains a Python module called `fresh_tomatoes.py`. The `fresh_tomatoes.py` module has a function called `open_movies_page` that takes in one argument, which is a list of movies, and creates an HTML file which will display all of your favorite movies.
